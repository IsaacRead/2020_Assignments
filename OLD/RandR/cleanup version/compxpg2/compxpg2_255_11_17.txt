Task 1: MP3 Player

Open the project called PracP4. It contains a C# program that is the basis [
of a simple mp3 player. The form contains a listbox for viewing a playlist

of mp3 songs, and controls for loading and saving playlists, and for
adding and removing mp3s from a playlist.

The project has a class called Song that stores details about a song anda
class called Playlist that stores all songs in the playlist. Playlist has an
aggregation relationship to Song, i. Playlist ‘has a’ Song. Each class
has appropriate constructors, properties and methods to access and
update the information in each class.

Play with the mp3 player and see what works and what doesn’t.
Understand how the existing code works. Then alter the code to
implement the following features:

Ll. Saving Playlists

Write code for the Save Playlist menu item that saves the currently
selected playlist to a CSV file. Use a Save File Dialog window to ask the
user where to save the playlist. Make the initial suggested filename the
same as the name of the playlist. The information about each song in the
playlist should be saved to the file in CSV format, with one record for
each song.

2. Generating a Playlist by Rating

Add a feature that lets the user input a rating value with which the
program will automatically gcncrate a new playlist from the currently
selected playlist that contains only songs that have that rating value. For
more challenge, have it generate the new playlist from songs in all
playlists currently open (sec step 3 below).
