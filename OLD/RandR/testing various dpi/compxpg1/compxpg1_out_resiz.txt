The file timmovies.csv contains the movie viewing details of a customer
called Tim. Write a program that reads each line from the file and creates
a movie viewing object using the data. It then checks if the points have

* expired (using today’s date), and displays the information about the
points with either the word “expired” or “unclaimed”. You do not need to
store all of the movie viewing objects at this stage (see below). You can
also check your code on the file gawain.csv.

Extend your code to store a list of movie-viewing objects along with the ~
members number, Change the code from step 1 to check if the points
have expired by looping through the list, rather than as they have been
read from the file. Note that this will now need to happen after you have
finished reading the file. Check that your points expiry code still works.
